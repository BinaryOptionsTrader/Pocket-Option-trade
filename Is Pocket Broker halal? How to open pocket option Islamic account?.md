## üîç What is Pocket Option?

**Pocket Option** is a digital trading platform launched in 2017 by Gembell Limited. It allows traders to speculate on a wide range of assets, including:

- Forex pairs
- Stocks
- Commodities
- Cryptocurrencies

Unlike traditional brokers, Pocket Option specializes in **binary options**, offering traders a chance to predict whether an asset will go up or down within a fixed time frame.

> ‚ö° Why it matters: Binary options are controversial in Islamic finance, which is why we need to take a deep look at their structure.

## üïå Understanding Halal vs Haram in Trading

In Islamic finance, all transactions must avoid:

- **Riba (interest)**
- **Gharar (excessive uncertainty)**
- **Maisir (gambling)**

‚úÖ **Halal trading** must involve tangible assets, clear terms, and ethical behavior. Common halal trading formats include spot forex (without interest), stock trading in Shariah-compliant companies, and commodity trading.

Binary options can resemble **maisir (gambling)** due to their high-risk, all-or-nothing structure.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Binary Options: Are They Halal or Haram?

This is the *core debate*. Many scholars argue that binary options are **haram** because:

- They involve **speculation, not asset ownership**
- Payouts are fixed regardless of how far the price moves
- There's a resemblance to betting (maisir)

However, others say it's context-dependent. If trades are used for **hedging or informed speculation** and not purely gambling, there's room for discussion.

üí• **Key takeaway:** Most Islamic scholars consider binary options haram, but interpretations vary. Always consult your local imam or Shariah board.
