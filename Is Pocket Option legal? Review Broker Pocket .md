With a user-friendly interface, quick trade execution, and multiple social trading features, **_Pocket Option_** has become a favorite among many retail traders worldwide. But, the big question still remains: _Is it really safe to use?_ 

---

## ✅ **Is Pocket Option Legal?**

The short answer: **_Yes, but with conditions._**

Pocket Option operates legally in many countries where binary options trading is permitted. However, it **is not regulated** by top-tier financial authorities like the **FCA (UK)**, **CySEC (Cyprus)**, or **ASIC (Australia)**.

Unlike some brokers that operate without any oversight, **Pocket Option** has a certification from the **IFMRRC**. Here’s what you need to know:

- **License Type**: Certification of compliance.
- **Issuing Body**: International Financial Market Relations Regulation Center (IFMRRC).
- **Status**: Valid and publicly listed on their website.

💥 *Important note*: Being regulated by IFMRRC is better than being completely unregulated, but it does not offer the same protection as licenses from FCA or ASIC.
