## **Introduction to Pocket Option** 💥

Pocket Option has quickly become a **well-known name** in the **binary options** world. Launched in **2017**, it offers a **user-friendly platform**, **high payouts**, and a wide range of **assets** to trade.

Despite its popularity, one major question persists: _**Is Pocket Option truly regulated?**_ Let's explore the facts. ✅

---

## **Is Pocket Option Regulated?** 

The direct answer is: **Pocket Option is NOT regulated** by any **top-tier financial authority** like the **FCA**, **CySEC**, or **ASIC**.

However, Pocket Option is **registered under the International Financial Market Relations Regulation Center (IFMRRC)**. 📋

> **Important:**  
> The IFMRRC is a private regulatory organization, not a government body. Thus, while it provides some level of oversight, it doesn't offer the same protection as **official regulatory agencies**.

🔎 _In short: Pocket Option has a **basic license**, but it's not equivalent to a government-issued license._

## **Company Background and Licensing**

- **Official Name:** Gembell Limited
- **Location:** Registered in the Marshall Islands
- **Regulatory Status:** Member of IFMRRC (License No. TSRF RU 0395 AA Vv0124)
- **Establishment Year:** 2017

📌 While the Marshall Islands registration enables broader international operations, it also means **less strict financial scrutiny** compared to heavily regulated jurisdictions.
