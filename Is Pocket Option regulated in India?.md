## Pocket Option Regulation Explained

Pocket Option is *licensed* by the **IFMRRC** — the *International Financial Market Relations Regulation Center*. However, it’s important to understand that:

- **IFMRRC is not a government regulatory authority** like India's SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India).
- Licensing by IFMRRC provides *some protection* but *not the same level of security* as government-backed regulation.
  
💥 **Important:** As of 2025, Pocket Option is **NOT regulated** by any Indian authority like SEBI. 

Still, millions of users trade on Pocket Option because of its **transparency**, **fast payouts**, and **user-friendly platform**.
