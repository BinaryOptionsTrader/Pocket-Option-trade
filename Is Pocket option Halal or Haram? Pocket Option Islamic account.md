## **Introduction** ✅

Navigating the trading landscape while adhering to *Islamic principles* is not always straightforward. In Islam, activities involving *riba (interest)*, *gharar (excessive uncertainty)*, and *gambling (maysir)* are strictly forbidden. So, how does **Pocket Option** fit into this picture? Let's find out together! 💥

## **Understanding Halal and Haram in Trading**

In Islamic finance, for a trading activity to be **Halal**, it must avoid:
- **Riba** (interest)
- **Gharar** (excessive uncertainty)
- **Maysir** (gambling)

Trading can be considered Halal if:
- The transaction is free from interest-based elements.
- It involves real assets or financial instruments.
- It does not rely on pure chance.

Binary options, like those offered by many brokers, often tread a fine line between **Halal** and **Haram**, making due diligence essential.
